----

We have been contracted by a company (*Not Evil Inc.â„¢*), to update their existing Dinosaur based blog platform to use React.JS. 

Before we jump ahead, let's build an example component for our new employer to show them how easy and fun React will be!

----
### Setup

Create a new react app called `dino-blog` using `create-react-app`.

----
### Create a React Component

Inside of `./src` folder, create a new React Component file called `Post.js`.

- `author`
- `content`: should render one or more paragraphs of content
- `comments`: should render one or more comments


----
### Deliverable
Your final solution should look like the following rendered post:
